Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This repository explores car price prediction using linear regression, a machine learning technique. The project aims to build a model that estimates the fair market value of a car based on various features that influence its price.

Project Goals
Train a linear regression model to predict car prices.
Analyze the impact of different car features on the predicted price.
Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy.
Getting Started
This project requires Python and relevant libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
The project analysis and model building are contained in the car_price_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Open it in your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment to explore the code and results.

Data
The project utilizes a car dataset .
